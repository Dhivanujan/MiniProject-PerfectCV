# Project Cleanup Guide

## Files Removed After React Migration

After migrating from Flask templates to React frontend, the following unnecessary files have been removed:

### ✅ Cleaned Up
- **Python Cache Files**: `__pycache__/` directories and `.pyc` files
- **System Files**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini` (if any existed)
- **Temporary Files**: `*.tmp`, `*.log` files

### 📁 Current Project Structure

```
MiniProject-PerfectCV/
├── frontend/                    # ✅ New React application
│   ├── src/
│   ├── public/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── README.md
├── static/                      # ✅ Keep - Static assets for both Flask & React
│   ├── CV.png
│   ├── Hero.png
│   └── Logo.png
├── venv/                        # ⚠️  Keep - Python virtual environment
├── app.py                       # ✅ Keep - Flask backend (needs API conversion)
├── README.md                    # ✅ Keep - Project documentation
├── REACT_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md     # ✅ Keep - Migration documentation
└── .git/                       # ✅ Keep - Git repository
```

## 🔧 Next Steps

### 1. Copy Static Assets
Copy images from `static/` to `frontend/public/static/`:
```bash
# From the main project directory
xcopy static frontend\public\static\ /E /I
# or
cp -r static/* frontend/public/static/
```

### 2. Install React Dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Update Flask Backend
Convert Flask routes to API endpoints to support the React frontend.

### 4. Optional: Remove Flask Templates (if completely migrated)
Since we've moved to React, the old Flask template system is no longer needed.

## 🗑️ Files You Can Safely Remove Later

Once you're confident the React migration is complete:

### Flask Template-Related Files (if no longer needed):
- Any remaining `templates/` directory
- Flask template rendering code in `app.py`

### Development Files:
- `venv/` (if you prefer using a different Python environment)
- Any backup files you may have created

## ⚠️ Files to NEVER Remove
- `app.py` - Your Flask backend
- `static/` - Images and assets
- `frontend/` - Your new React application
- `.git/` - Your version control history
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `venv/` - Unless you have another Python environment setup

## 📝 Notes
- The cleanup focused on development artifacts and cache files
- All source code and assets have been preserved
- The React frontend maintains the same visual design as the original Flask templates
- The Flask backend still needs to be converted to API endpoints to work with React
